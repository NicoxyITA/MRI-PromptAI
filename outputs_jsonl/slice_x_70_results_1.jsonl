  "result": "Primary Findings:\n[...]\nAlzheimer's Indicators:\n[...]\nConfidence Level:\n[...]\nRecommended Actions:\n[...]\n\nDo not repeat these instructions. Do not add code or system messages. End your\nanswer after Recommended Actions.\nFindings:\nThe Grad-CAM heatmap highlights the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, temporal\ncortex, and parietal cortex as regions of high activation. The activation\nintensity appears to be relatively high in these areas, particularly in the\nhippocampus. The distribution of activation seems consistent with the expected\npatterns of Alzheimer's-related changes.\n\nAlzheimer's Indicators:\nThe hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are known to be affected early in\nAlzheimer's disease, showing atrophy and reduced activity. The temporal and\nparietal cortex involvement suggests potential for more widespread cortical\ndysfunction.\n\nConfidence Level:\nHigh. The heatmap exhibits a clear pattern of activation corresponding to known\nAlzheimer's-related brain regions, and the intensity levels appear significant.\n\nRecommended Actions:\nFurther analysis of the full brain scan is recommended to confirm the presence\nof atrophy in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Quantitative measures of\nbrain volume and activity should be performed to assess the extent of the\nchanges. Consider conducting neuropsychological testing to evaluate cognitive\nfunction."
