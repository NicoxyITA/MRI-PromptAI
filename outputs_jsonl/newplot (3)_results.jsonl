  "result": "Primary Findings: [...] Alzheimer's Indicators: [...] Confidence Level: [...]\nRecommended Actions: [...] Do not repeat these instructions. Do not add code or\nsystem messages. End your answer after Recommended Actions. Findings: The\nGrad-CAM heatmap shows strong activation in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex,\ntemporal cortex, and parietal cortex. The intensity of activation is\nparticularly high in the hippocampus, suggesting a strong indicator of\nAlzheimer's disease. The distribution of activation appears to be consistent\nwith known Alzheimer's pathology, with increased activity in regions associated\nwith memory and cognition. Alzheimer's Indicators: High activation in the\nhippocampus and entorhinal cortex, indicating potential memory impairment and\nearly Alzheimer's disease. Confidence Level: High Recommended Actions: Further\nanalysis using additional imaging modalities (e.g., MRI) and clinical data is\nrecommended to confirm the presence of Alzheimer's disease and assess the\nseverity of the condition. Longitudinal monitoring is also necessary to track\ndisease progression."
