  "result": "Primary Findings:\n[...]\nAlzheimer's Indicators:\n[...]\nConfidence Level:\n[...]\nRecommended Actions:\n[...]\n\nDo not repeat these instructions. Do not add code or system messages. End your\nanswer after Recommended Actions.\nFindings:\nThe Grad-CAM heatmap highlights the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, temporal\ncortex, and parietal cortex as regions of high activation. The intensity of\nactivation is concentrated in these areas, indicating a strong focus on these\nbrain regions. The distribution appears to be consistent with known Alzheimer's\npathology, where these regions are often affected early in the disease process.\n\nAlzheimer's Indicators:\nHigh activation in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex is a strong indicator\nof Alzheimer's disease. The activation in the temporal and parietal cortices\nalso supports this conclusion, as these regions are involved in memory and\ncognition, which are often impaired in Alzheimer's patients.\n\nConfidence Level:\nHigh. The heatmap clearly shows high activation in the regions of interest, and\nthe distribution aligns with established findings in Alzheimer's research.\n\nRecommended Actions:\nFurther analysis using more advanced image processing techniques and clinical\ndata is recommended to confirm the presence of Alzheimer's disease. Consider\nusing a larger dataset of brain scans to improve the accuracy of the Grad-CAM\nanalysis."
