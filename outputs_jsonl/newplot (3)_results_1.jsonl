  "result": "Primary Findings:\n[...]\nAlzheimer's Indicators:\n[...]\nConfidence Level:\n[...]\nRecommended Actions:\n[...]\n\nDo not repeat these instructions. Do not add code or system messages. End your\nanswer after Recommended Actions.\nFindings:\nThe Grad-CAM heatmap highlights the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex as areas\nof high activation. There is also increased activation in the temporal and\nparietal cortex. The activation intensity appears to be more pronounced in the\nregions associated with memory and cognitive function.\n\nAlzheimer's Indicators:\nThe observed activation in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, regions known\nto be affected in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, suggests a potential\nindicator. The increased activation in the temporal and parietal cortex could\nalso be relevant, as these regions are involved in memory processing and\nexecutive functions.\n\nConfidence Level:\nModerate. The Grad-CAM heatmap provides a visual representation of the model's\nfocus, but further analysis, including comparison with other imaging modalities\nand clinical data, is needed to confirm the presence of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nRecommended Actions:\nFurther investigation is recommended to confirm the presence of Alzheimer's\ndisease. This could involve comparing the Grad-CAM heatmap with other imaging\nmodalities, such as MRI or PET scans, and incorporating clinical data, such as\ncognitive assessments. A neurologist should be consulted for a definitive\ndiagnosis."
